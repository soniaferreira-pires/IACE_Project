Machine Learning (ML) project focused on diabetes prediction, focusing on pregnant women over 21 with diabetes. Several classification ML algorithms including Decision Tree, KNN, and AdaBoost were used, and then evaluated for performance with metrics like precision, accuracy, f-measure, and recall. These results are then verified using the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves properly and systematically.
